##Organizing Policies

1. Put all policies in the 'policy' directory
2. Organize policies into workflow folders.
3. Policies can be scoped to just about anything -- use cases, applications, jobs, services, hosts, layers, etc.

##Policy Naming Conventions

1. Avoid extra long folder names and complex hierarchical structures.
2. Use the underscore ( _ ) as element delimiter.
3. Elements should be ordered from general to specific detail of importance as much as possible.
4. Dates should be ordered: YEAR, MONTH, DAY. (e.g. YYYYMMDD, YYYYMMDD, YYYYMM).
5. Keep it clean. No need for capitalization.
